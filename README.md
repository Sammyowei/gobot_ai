It leverages cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide an intelligent and interactive chatbot experience.

### 2. Contextual Responses

The chatbot maintains context across conversations, allowing it to provide relevant and meaningful responses based on the ongoing discussion. It understands context shifts, references to previous messages, and can generate coherent and contextually appropriate replies.

### 3. Multi-turn Conversations

Gobot AI supports multi-turn conversations, enabling users to have extended and continuous interactions. It retains knowledge of past messages, allowing for more engaging and interactive conversations that flow naturally.
